# CryptoClustering

In this challenge, youâ€™ll use your knowledge of Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

Using the crpyto_market_data_csv in Resources to prepare the data and find the best value for k.

Steps:

Prepare the Data

Cluster cryptocurrencies with k-means using the original scaled data 

Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis

Find the Best Value for k Using the PCA Data

Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data

Conclusions:

Reducing the number of feasters to cluster the data leads to more accurate results.
